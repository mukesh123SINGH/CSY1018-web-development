			HTML means Hypertext markup Language, this language is mostly used for creating the website. It is most popular and widely used language in the world. It was first developed in 1991 by Berners Lee but there is lot of bugs into the language so it was again lunched in 1999. And widely used into the world. Till now HTML updated five times with different version, new version was launched into 2012 A.D. and this version is still used in the world. HTML helps the user to make the framework of website.

			CSS means Cascading Style Sheets. This is widely used to decorate the HTML file. HTML is nothing without CSS because it helps give the lookup of the site. HTML provides the structural framework while CSS provide decorative things to the HTML file. Decorative material like color, text style, margin, padding and so on. It is very useful for decorate the framework designed by the user suing HTML. It is the backbone of the website. without its website looks very unsatisfying.

			While making this website, there is five pages into the website. i.e., home page, Portfolio page, Contact page, CV page and Site Report page. this all page contains the information. where home page contains the information about myself, portfolio contains the information about my pictures, contact page contains the information about contact with me or email me or message me, CV page contains the information about my skills, education, my introduction and my hobby.

			This project helps me to design the portfolio project and get better knowledge about the HTML and CSS. while making this project lot of obstacles are occurred but the guidance provided by the university and the teacher team of the college. I finally completed this project. Html and CSS are very friendly language to developer to design the website because this language is easy to understand. if I get more chance then i will add more magical function into this website.
